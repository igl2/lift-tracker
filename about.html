            This website is a helpful fitness tool for beginners who are looking to get started on their
            fitness journey or even regular gym-goers who are looking to try an app like this. This tool can help
            beginners get started on basic fitness knowledge as well as a way to record their
            progress so they can keep track of their results. This can be done by typing the exercise down, logging in
            the amount of time, number of sets,
            or number of repetitions accomplished by each exercise. The reason this web app is being created is so
            beginners can get started working out with a boost of confidence that they know what they are doing and how
            they are progressing. Knowing their progress is important because they want to assure that they are meeting
            their fitness goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are three popular fitness sites that I referred to get an idea of how I want this web application to
            be. The first one is <a class="about-page-link" href="https://www.myfitnesspal.com/"
                target="_blank">MyFitnessPal</a>. It is a
            popular food calorie, macronutrient, and micronutrient
            tracker. But it doesn't just track food calories, it also allows users to track their workouts and calculate
            the
            number of calories they burned. <a class="about-page-link"
                href="https://www.bodybuilding.com/workout-plans2" target="_blank">BodyFit</a> is a good website for
            beginners who want to get started on their
            fitness journey. It allows users to choose various types of workout plans that can meet their
            goals. Their goals may include build muscle, loose fat, or stay lean. Finally, <a class="about-page-link"
                href="https://smartwod.app/" target="_blank">SmartWOD</a> is a mobile app that
            generates a series of WODs or “workout of the day” exercises that users can perform if they want to do more
            of a CrossFit type of workout. Although my ideal app may not be as robust as these three resources, it will
            be
            enough for someone who wants a basic workout tracker or generator that they can use and still meet their
            needs.
        </p>
        <header>
            <h2>This website serves two purposes&colon;</h2>
        </header>
        <header>
            <h3 class="about-page-h3">
                A Fitness Tracker
            </h3>
        </header>
        <p>This will allow users to keep track of their fitness goals by giving them a
            way to log in the number of sets, repetitions, and amount of time accomplished for each exercise.
            They would use this by choosing an exercise from a list or typing it down and recording the
            corresponding information accomplished by that exercise. It would
            be useful for users who want to continually see their progress in their workout routines.</p>
        <header>
            <h3 class="about-page-h3">
                A Workout Plan Creator
            </h3>
        </header>
        <p>This is to provide users a scheduled workout plan that they can follow. To use
            this app, the user would choose a category that they want depending on their fitness goal. Each
            category will have a list of exercises that they can follow or adjust them if needed. This is
            especially useful for beginners who want a workout plan to follow rather than creating their own.
